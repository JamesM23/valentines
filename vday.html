    <h1>Happy Valentine's Day Juanell </h1>

            <p>To love is to share life together,
                to build special plans just for two,
                to work side by side,
                and then smile with pride,
                as one by one, dreams all come true.
                
                To love is to help and encourage
                with smiles and sincere words of praise,
                to take time to share,
                in tender, affectionate ways.
                
                To love is to have someone special,
                one on whom you can always depend
                to be there through the years,
                as a partner, a lover, a friend.
                
                To love is to make special memories
                of moments you love to recall,
                of all the good things
                that sharing life brings.
                Love is the greatest of all.
                
                I've learned the full meaning
                of sharing and caring
                and having my dreams all come true;
                I've learned the full meaning
                of being in love
                by being and loving with you.
